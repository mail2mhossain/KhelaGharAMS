Files changed since version 5.6
In the folder NakedObjects.Mvc-Files(5.7.0).zip you will find files that would have been installed had you done a FreshInstall.  These can be compared against your own local files (which you might have modified).  The following describes changes you should look at, in the various standard folders within a MVC project.
App_Start folder
Changes to files in this folder are needed only if you wish to have the option to make the Resftul API available on this project (recommended).  Note that even when these files are updated, the Restful API is not activated (for security reasons) until you specify a non-null value for the (new) RestRoot property on RunWeb.
NakedObjectsStart.cs  - changed
RestConfig - added
RestDependencyResolver - added
RunWeb.cs  - changed
Content folder
NakedObjects.css  -  minor change
Controllers folder
SystemController.cs - changes to ClearHistoryItem() and ClearHistoryOthers(). These must be changed in order to compile.
RestfulObjectsController.cs  added (needed only if you wish to use the Restful Objects API).
Scripts folder
NakedObjects-Ajax.js - Multiple changes
Views folder
Changes have been made to several of the generic views found in the Views > Shared folder.  These changes have two purposes:
- to honour the new [PresentationHint()] attribute (when used).
- to take advantage of a framework change, such that query results can now be rendered as tabs, like other objects.
FormFinderWithDialog - IdHelper.ObjectEditName  > Html.ObjectEditClass(Model.ContextObject)FormWithSelections - as above.
ObjectEdit - as above
ObjectView - IdHelper.ObjectViewName > Html.ObjectViewClass(Model)
ScalarView - as above
ViewModel - IdHelper.ViewModelName > Html.ViewModelClass(Model) .  (Additionally note the new comment explaining that this view is used only when a view model is in edit mode. Otherwise a viewmodel is rendered using ObjectView.)
StandaloneTable  - Html.TabbedHistory() > Html.TabbedHistory(Model)   and 
                                       Html.Object(Model.Result) > Html.ActionResult(Model)
DialogControl - IdHelper.DialogNameClass > Model.DialogClass()
